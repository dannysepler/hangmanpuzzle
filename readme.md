# Hangman Puzzle

Welcome to Ronnie's Games! You have just been hired as an expert Java programmer, and boy do we need your help. Our lead developer, hard at work on a hangman game, has just mysteriously disappeared. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to finish his work. Can you do that?

### Getting started

First you need to get his code. Open up the terminal window on your computer. (Click the top left button of the your computer screen, go to accessories, and then terminal. It should look like the thing people in action movies use when they hack into the system.)

1. Type `cd workspace` + Enter
2. Type 'git clone https://github.com/dannysepler/hangmanpuzzle.git' + Enter
3. Fire up Eclipse
4. File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Select root directory (Browse) -> highlight "hangmanpuzzle" and press "OK" -> Finish
5. Open hangmanpuzzle, open src, open (default package), and double click "hangman.java"

### Your job

You are in charge of filling in three high-priority methods: "userguess", "filled", and "fill". Instructions are commented inside each method. Have fun!
